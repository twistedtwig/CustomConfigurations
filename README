Custom Configurations:

Custom configurations is designed to reduce the repeative lines of code needed to get configuration settings into your application.  If there are 5 or 50 settings there doesn't need any extra code to get your settings.  It allows the application to simplify the use of configuration settings.  

A simple but effective use is to have an object with N number of properties, such as:

public class MyAppSettings
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }
    public bool ShouldDoX { get; set; }
    public int minValue { get; set; }
}

Then use the configuration loader to populate the values:

MyAppSettings appSettings = new CustomConfigurations.Config().Create<MyAppSettings>();

Another example is when the app has multiple clients settings to be recorded a section for each can be defined and the values seperated out.  The config class allows easy access to a clients configuration and deals with the configuration hooking up in the background for you.

At this point it is not possible to save back to the configuration file.  I have tried to get this to work across the board but failed misserably, will try to tackle this again at a later stage, (there are a few commented out sections and tests aimed at this in the committed code).

Here is an example configuration file:

<configuration>
  <configSections>
    <section name="testsection2" type="CustomConfigurations.ConfigurationSectionLoader, CustomConfigurations" />
    <sectionGroup name="myCustomGroup">
      <section name="mysection" type="CustomConfigurations.ConfigurationSectionLoader, CustomConfigurations" />
    </sectionGroup>
  </configSections>

  <myCustomGroup>
    <mysection>
      <Configs>
      <ConfigurationGroup name="client1">
        <ValueItems>
          <ValueItem key="key2" value="value2" />
          <ValueItem key="key3" value="value3" />
          <ValueItem key="key4" value="value4" />
          <ValueItem key="key5" value="7" />
          <ValueItem key="key6" value="0.6" />        
      </ConfigurationGroup>
	  <ConfigurationGroup name="client2">
          <ValueItems>
            <ValueItem key="keya" value="abc" />
            <ValueItem key="key2" value="123" />
          </ValueItems>
        </ConfigurationGroup>
      </Configs>
    </mysection>
  </myCustomGroup>

  <testsection2>
    <Configs>
      <ConfigurationGroup name="clienta">
        <ValueItems>
          <ValueItem key="key2" value="valueabc" />          
        </ValueItems>       
      </ConfigurationGroup>
    </Configs>
  </testsection2>
</configuration>

If the app wanted to read "client2"'s configuration it could do the following:

CustomConfigurations.Config Configloader = new CustomConfigurations.Config("client2");

To access a value it would use the index of the key:

string myVal = Configloader["keya"];

The console application "ExampleApp" shows the different ways the customConfiguration application can be used.

N.B. all config sections are case sensitive, be careful how you write the xml and using the selectors.
