Custom Configurations:

Custom configurations is designed to reduce the repeative lines of code needed to get configuration settings into your application.  If there are 5 or 50 settings there doesn't need any extra code to get your settings.  It allows the application to simplify the use of configuration settings.  

A simple but effective use is to have an object with N number of properties, such as:

public class MyAppSettings
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Location { get; set; }
    public bool ShouldDoX { get; set; }
    public int minValue { get; set; }
}

Then use the configuration loader to populate the values:

MyAppSettings appSettings = new CustomConfigurations.Config().Create<MyAppSettings>();

N.B. all config sections are case sensitive, be careful how you write the xml and using the selectors.
